# GDS3D
This is a fork from https://sourceforge.net/projects/gds3d.

The original developers and maintainers of GDS3D on sourceforge.net agreed to continue hosting the project on GitHub in order to be more accessible to developers. You are invited to propose features and report issues on this GitHub portal. 

If you want to help maintaining the project, feel free to contact me.

Since the creation of this repository in May, 2017 a few features have been added. See the Issue Tracker for more details.

# Unmaintained
As my personal interests have shifted away from IC design, I have no longer time and energy to maintain this (still very well working) project. There is another fork of trilomix, that has added a few features (https://github.com/trilomix/GDS3D) but is also unmaintained. If you have the interest in further maintaining features/issues, contact me.
